This is two-panel plot, which shows the data value distribution for five
response levels among locations in NY state in 2006 and 2010. Both in
2006 and 2010 plots, the “Poor” response has smallest range of data
values, while “Very Good” has the widest range.

We import and cleaned two datasets, then merge them by “seqn” which I
rename as “participants_id”.

    ## argument.

``` r
print(reader_table)
